Wordpress plugin to keep new plugin admin menu items in bottom

== Description ==

The "Keep New Plugin Admin Menu Items in Bottom" WordPress plugin is your solution for maintaining a tidy and organized admin menu in your WordPress dashboard. As your collection of plugins grows, you may have noticed that newly installed plugins tend to insert their menu items at the top of the admin menu, causing clutter and confusion for both you and your site's users. This can be frustrating and disrupt the logical flow of your WordPress admin area.

Our plugin addresses this issue by allowing you to keep newly added plugin admin menu items at the bottom of the menu, where they won't disrupt your established workflow. With just a few clicks, you can ensure that your most frequently used menu items remain easily accessible, without the need to scroll past newly installed plugins.
